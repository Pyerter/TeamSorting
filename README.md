# Summary
This is the official repository made to accompany the paper "Team 
Partitioning Approximation Algorithms".

## Dependencies
The TPP program relies on Google's OR Tools. Here is the link to the 
[OR-Tools API (Java)](https://or-tools.github.io/docs/javadoc/index.html).

## Running the Code
To run the code, you will need a properly formatted CSV file as input. In 
the `app` folder, you can find the relevant jar files and an accompanying 
csv formatted appropriately. To call the jar file via the command line, use 
the following command (assuming your pwd is the top-level folder of this 
repository):

``java ./app/teamSort.jar <csv_file_path> <p>``
